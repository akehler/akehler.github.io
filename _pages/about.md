Please bear with me as this page is under construction! (11/23/24) 

Hi!  I'm a Professor in the Linguistics Department at UC San Diego.  I direct one of the department's Computational Linguistics Labs, although in actuality the lab is highly interdisplinary, focused primarily (but not only) on pragmatics and discourse interpretation, studied from the perspectives of theoretical linguistics, computational linguistics, and psycholinguistics. Explore the links on this page to find out more about me.

My current students are <a HREF="https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/joshuawampler">Joshua Wampler</a> and <a href="https://pennydy.github.io/">Penny Pan</a>. 

I'm teaching Lign 17 (Making and Breaking Codes) this quarter (Fall 2024).      
My office hours are Mondays 1-2 (in person; AP&M 2442) and Fridays 3:30-5 (remote; contact me for room info).  

I'll also be teaching Lign 17 (Making and Breaking Codes) next quarter (Winter 2025).  
In the Spring, I'll be teaching Lign 17 and a new course, Lign 117 (The Language Code).
