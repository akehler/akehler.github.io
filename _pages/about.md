Please bear with me as this page is under construction! (11/23/24) 

Hi!  I'm a Professor in the Linguistics Department at UC San Diego.  I direct one of the department's Computational Linguistics Labs, although in actuality the lab is highly interdisplinary, focused primarily (but not only) on pragmatics and discourse interpretation, studied from the perspectives of theoretical linguistics, computational linguistics, and psycholinguistics. Explore the links on this page to find out more about me.

My current student is <a href="https://pennydy.github.io/">Penny Pan</a>. 

Congratuations to <a HREF="https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/joshuawampler">Joshua Wampler</a>, who successfully defended his thesis on 12/9/24! 

I'm teaching Lign 17 (Making and Breaking Codes) and Lign 117 (The Language Code) this quarter (Spring 2025).    

My office hours are Wednesdays 2:30-4 (in person; AP&M 2442) and Fridays 3:30-5 (remote; contact me for room info).
