Please bera with me as this page is under construction! (11/23/24) 

Hi!  I'm a Professor in the Linguistics Department at UC San Diego.  I direct one of the department's Computational Linguistics Labs, although in actuality the lab is highly interdisplinary, focused primarily (but not only) on pragmatics and discourse interpretation, studied from the perspectives of theoretical linguistics, computational linguistics, and psycholinguistics. Explore the links on this page to find out more about me.

My current students are Joshua Wampler and <a href="https://pennydy.github.io/"Penny Pan<\a>.
